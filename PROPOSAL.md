Creating a more visual represantation of the Kamernet data, doing this by going full stack and supplying my own data

Custom map of Amsterdam:
* Insta API for place pictures
* Joint with a three of neighborhoodâ€™s  (south- > nieuw-zuid -> buitenverdert)
* Calander per day and hour of the frequency of post/number of post.
* Login + prediction calculator + notifications?

Steps:
1.	Data scaping, Automation and database.
2.	Data parsing library to csv or json + insta API
3.	Map prototype of Amsterdam
4.	Get a working version for the three and calander
5.	Work on predictions (linear regression) incl. probabilities.
6.	Setting up a server, Flask RESTful-API + Site hosting.
7.	Design and code upgrade.

Planning:
Week 1. 1+2
Week 2. 3+4
Week 3. 5+6
Week 4. 7 + More API
