# DataVisualisation
D3 show off resp


# Proposal project

Scraping (maybe live updating by server and database) Kamernet.nl and visualizing the result in a more interactive way.
Also makes it  possiple to predict your room price (linear regression model).

###visualisations:
 * Custom map
 * Calander view of upload freqency
 * Tree visualisation of neighbourhood arrangement in Amsterdam.
 * Small graphs of trends


Of course they are linked, showing when stuff is uploaded and all room information.

Probably only for amsterdam, since more features are more impressive then more cities. Flask backend, own server, python preprocessing, d3 visuals, map + street view --> average for the month, histogram for room size, scatter plot for roomsize and price. and many more.
