# Proposal project

Scraping (maybe live updating by server and database) Kamernet and visualizing the result in a more interactive way.
Also makes it  possiple to predict your room price (linear regression model).

Probably only for amsterdam, since more features are more impressive then more cities. Flask backend, own server, python preprocessing, d3 visuals, map + street view --> average for the month, histogram for room size, scatter plot for roomsize and price. and many more.
